# Jammming

My first time making a react app and using an API.
Jammming is a project for codecademy.

The function of this app is to allow the user to search using Spotify's API 
and create custom playlists that will be saved to the user's Spotify account.

## How to run the program

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
